DEADFACE has been targeting De Monne employees based on the recent De Monne financial database leak. De Monne has already changed their employees' passwords, but they would like you to try to crack the victim's password to see how secure it is and what they can do to train their employees to use proper cyber security hygiene. Submit the flag as flag{password}.

## First attempt
First I tried to crack the hash in the mysqldump from the earlier tasks.
The potential victim Merrilee Lawless is an employee.
